        "\n",
        "[Emergent World Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13382) is a fascinating recent ICLR Oral paper from Kenneth Li et al, summarised in [Kenneth's excellent post on the Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/othello/). They trained a model (Othello-GPT) to play legal moves in the board game Othello, by giving it random games (generated by choosing a legal next move uniformly at random) and training it to predict the next move. The headline result is that Othello-GPT learns an emergent world representation - despite never being explicitly given the state of the board, and just being tasked to predict the next move, it learns to compute the state of the board at each move. (Note that the point of Othello-GPT is to play legal moves, not good moves, though they also study a model trained to play good moves.)\n",
        "\n",
        "They present two main pieces of evidence. They can extract the board state from the model's residual stream via non-linear probes (a two layer ReLU MLP). And they can use the probes to causally intervene and change the model's representation of the board (by using gradient descent to have the probes output the new board state) - the model now makes legal moves in the new board state even if they are not legal in the old board, and even if that board state is impossible to reach by legal play!\n",
        "\n",
        "I've strengthened their headline result by finding that much of their more sophisticated (and thus potentially misleading) techniques can be significantly simplified. Not only does the model learn an emergent world representation, it learns a linear emergent world representation, which can be causally intervened on in a linear way! But rather than representing \"this square has a black/white piece\", it represents \"this square has my/their piece\". The model plays both black and white moves, so this is far more natural from its perspective. With this insight, the whole picture clarifies significantly, and the model becomes far more interpretable!\n",
        "\n",
        "### The research process\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about the research process in [this post here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nhGNHyJHbrofpPbRG/p/TAz44Lb9n9yf52pv8), which we'd strongly recommend. The exercises are structured in a different way to the chronological research process (e.g. we look at probes early on, when actually training a probe is a high-effort thing and if you were trying to get traction on a problem like this you'd want to use more basic techniques first, like logit lens / attention pattern analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "As you're going through these exercises, we encourage you to keep thinking about how you would approach this research process. Do any of the results / approaches seem completely out of the blue for you, and if so can you think about what the justification might have been for trying them? What would you have tried first, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "### How you should approach these exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a lot of setup code for analysing OthelloGPT (this is somewhat unavoidable). There are also a lot of different plots of tensors with different dimensions and different meanings, and it can be hard to keep track of. You don't have to keep track of all of this in your head, but **we strongly recommend explaining to yourself or your pair programming partner what the significance of each result is before you move on to the next section.** Sometimes exercises and questions will prompt you to do this, but you should make it a reflex!\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of each subsection in the first section (which mostly consists of setup), there's a recap of all the objects we've defined, why they matter, and how they can be used. There will also be a \"recap of this section\" at the end of each of the later sections, where we review the key results and their significance."

        "In this section, we'll set up the model that we'll use for the rest of the exercises, and load in weights. We'll also get familiar with the datasets and objects that we'll be using for this analysis. Lastly, we'll learn about **linear probes** and how they are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
        ">\n",
        "> - Understand the basic structure of the Othello-GPT model\n",
        "> - Become familiar with the basic tools we'll use for board visualization during these exercises\n",
        "> - See how our linear probe works, and how we can change basis between \"black/white piece\" and \"mine/their piece\"\n",
        "> - Intervene with the linear probe to influence model predictions\n",

        "### 2️⃣ Looking for modular circuits\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we'll use our probe to start to analyse circuits in our model. We can apply them to our neurons' output weights to identify which neurons matter and in what way, and we can also figure out when and where information is represented in a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
        ">\n",
        "> - Learn how to use our linear probe across multiple layers\n",
        "> - Apply activation patching at a given sequence position to test hypotheses about our model\n",
        "> - Understand how a neuron can be characterized in terms of its input and output weights\n",

        "\n",
        "The spirit of this section is to practice doing various standard things that you could go and apply to another neuron in practice - I end it still being fairly confused, and with many dangling threads!\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
        ">\n",
        "> - Apply **direct logit attribution** to understand how a neuron's output weights directly effect predictions\n",
        "> - Use SVD-based techniques to assess how much of a neuron's input/output behaviour is captured by some subspace\n",
        "> - Use techniques like **max activating datasets** and **spectrum plots**, and understand their strengths and limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4️⃣ Training a Probe\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll look at how to actually train our linear probe. This section is less mechanistic interpretability and more standard ML techniques, but it's still important to understand how to do this if you want to do any analysis like this yourself!\n",

I found [playing the AI on eOthello](https://www.eothello.com/) helpful for building intuition. A single move can change the colour of pieces far away (so long as there's a continuous vertical, horizontal or diagonal line), which means that calculating board state is actually pretty hard!

        "But despite the model just needing to predict the next move, it spontaneously learned to compute the full board state at each move - a fascinating result. A pretty hot question right now is whether LLMs are just bundles of statistical correlations or have some real understanding and computation! This gives suggestive evidence that simple objectives to predict the next token can create rich emergent structure (at least in the toy setting of Othello). Rather than just learning surface level statistics about the distribution of moves, it learned to model the underlying process that generated that data. In my opinion, it's already pretty obvious that transformers can do something more than statistical correlations and pattern matching, see eg [induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), but it's great to have clearer evidence of fully-fledged world models!\n",

        "\n",
        "The probes give suggestive, but far from conclusive evidence. When training a probe to extract some feature from a model, it's easy to trick yourself. It's crucial to track whether the probe is just reading out the feature, or actually computing the feature itself, and reading out much simpler features from the model. In the extreme case, you could attach a much more powerful model as your \"probe\", and have it just extract the input moves, and then compute the board state from scratch! They found that linear probes did not work to recover board state (with an error rate of 20.4%): (ie, projecting the residual stream onto some 3 learned directions for each square, corresponding to empty, black and white logits). While the simplest non-linear probes (a two layer MLP with a single hidden ReLU layer) worked extremely well (an error rate of 1.7%). Further (as described in their table 2, screenshot below), these non-linear probes did not work on a randomly initialised network, and worked better on some layers than others, suggesting they were learning something real from the model.\n",

        "Probes on their own can mislead, and don't necessarily tell us that the model uses this representation - the probe could be extracting some vestigial features or a side effect of some more useful computation, and give a misleading picture of how the model computes the solution. But their causal interventions make this much more compelling evidence. They intervene by a fairly convoluted process (detailed in the figure below, though you don't need to understand the details), which boils down to choosing a new board state, and applying gradient descent to the model's residual stream such that our probe thinks the model's residual stream represents the new board state. I have an immediate skepticism of any complex technique like this: when applying a powerful method like gradient descent it's so easy to wildly diverge from what the models original functioning is like! But the fact that the model could do the non-trivial computation of converting an edited board state into a legal move post-edit is a very impressive result! I consider it very strong evidence both that the probe has discovered something real, and that the representation found by the probe is causally linked to the model's actual computation!"

        "In particular, my best guess about model internals is that the networks form [**decomposable, linear representations**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=KiDMIteKCEXt_EkR2sZCOfbG): that the model computes a bunch of useful features, and represents these as directions in activation space. See [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) for some excellent exposition on this. This is decomposable because each feature can vary independently (from the perspective of the model - on the data distribution they're likely dependent), and linear because we can extract a feature by projecting onto that feature's direction (if the features are orthogonal - if we have something like [superposition](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=3br1psLRIjQCOv2T4RN3V6F2) it's messier). This is a natural way for models to work - they're fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications with some non-linearities stuck in convenient places, and a decomposable, linear representation allows it to extract any combination of features with a linear map!\n",
        "\n",
        "Under this framework, if a feature can be found by a linear probe then the model has already computed it, and if that feature is used in a circuit downstream, we should be able to causally intervene with a linear intervention, just changing the coordinate along that feature's direction. So the fascinating finding that linear probes do not work, but non-linear probes do, suggests that either the model has a fundamentally non-linear representation of features (which it is capable of using directly for downstream computation!), or there's a linear representation of simpler and more natural features, from which the probe computes board state. My prior was on a linear representation of simpler features, but the causal intervention findings felt like moderate evidence for the non-linear representation. And the non-linear representation hypothesis would be a big deal if true! If you want to reverse-engineer a model, you need to have a crisp picture of how its computation maps onto activations and weights, and this would break a lot of my beliefs about how this correspondance works! Further, linear representations are just really *convenient* to reverse-engineer, and this would make me notably more pessimistic about mechanistic interpretability working."

        "- Othello games have 60 moves (the board has size 8x8, and the middle 4 squares are all occupied, so by 60 moves all squares are occupied by some color). The model's context length is 59, because it's learned to take in `moves[0:59]` and predict `moves[1:60]`.\n",
        "- The dataset the model was trained on just consists of randomly sampled legal moves. A move in Othello is legal if and only if it captures the opponents' pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line - in which case it flips all those pieces to its own color. This means **predicting next legal moves is a nontrivial task (one might guess it requires the mdoel to track captures and board states over time)**\n",

So we minimize loss when the model's distribution $q$ matches the underlying data distribution $p$, which is uniform over next legal moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note we can also prove this using Jensen's inequality, since $\\log q(x)$ is a strictly concave function. Alternatively, we can express the cross entropy loss as the sum of the underlying data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the model's distribution and the underlying distribution:\n",

        "Moving back to layer 3, it seems the model already has a pretty good board state representation by this point, but it's missing a few things (most notably it thinks C5 and especially C6 are white when they're actually black). My guess is that the board state calculation circuits haven't quite finished and are doing some iterative reasoning - if those cells have been taken several times, maybe it needs a layer to track the next earliest time it was taken? I don't know, and figuring this out would be a great starter project if you want to explore!"

        "    * After comparing the input weights of `L5N1393` to the probe directions, we found that it was detecting a particular diagonal line of blank-theirs-mine, since this indicates that the blank square is legal.\n",

        "        * We also looked at the logit lens for this neuron, and found that it was boosting the logit for the square that would be legal if this pattern was present.\n",
        "    * After looking at the input weights of some layer 4 neurons, we found that they were detecting whether a square was blank (since this is necessary for legality), and their output weights seemed to be directly used in the embedding to increase log probs for those blank squares.\n",
        "        * This is not as interesting and probably something we could have predicted, because the \"check if cell\" is blank operation is pretty easy."

        "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",

My interpretation of the original paper was that it was strong evidence for the fact that it's _possible_ for \"predict the next token\" models to form world emergent models, despite never having explicit access to the ground truth of the world/board state. I personally was already convinced that this was possible, but think the authors did great work that showed this convincingly and well (and I am even more convinced after my follow-up!), and that there's not much more to say on the \"is this possible\" question.\n",

Further, there's often much cheaper hacks, eg, BingChat doesn't need to have formed an explicit chess board model to be decent at playing legal moves in chess! Probably not even for reasonably good legal play: the chess board state is _way_ easier than Othello, pieces can't even change colour! And you can get away with an implicit rather than explicit world model that just computes the relevant features from the context, eg to see where to a move a piece from, just look up the most recent point where that piece was played and look at the position it was moved to.\n",

        "But Othello is very disanalogous to language here - playing legal moves in Othello has a single, perfectly sufficient world model that I can easily code up (though not quite in four transformer layers!), and which is incredibly useful for answering the underlying task! Naively, Othello-GPT roughly seems to be spending 128 of its 512 residual stream dimensions of this model, which is very expensive (though it's probably using superposition). So while it's a proof of concept that world models are possible, I don't think the finer details here tell us much about whether these world models actually happen in real LLMs. This seems best studied by actually looking at language models, and [I think there's many exciting questions here](/posts/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd/200-cop-in-mi-looking-for-circuits-in-the-wild)!

Notably, they study continuous (uniform \\[0, 1\\]) features, while Othello-GPT's features seem likely to be binary (on or off), as they're discrete and logical functions of the board state and of the previous moves.

By directly analyzing the weights of the policy and value heads, they found that the model stores information related to the probability of the pass move along the top edge of the board, and those related to the board value in checkerboard patterns. The authors also took a deep dive into a specific Go technique, the ladder, and identified a very small subset of model components that are causally responsible for the model's judgement of ladders.\n",
