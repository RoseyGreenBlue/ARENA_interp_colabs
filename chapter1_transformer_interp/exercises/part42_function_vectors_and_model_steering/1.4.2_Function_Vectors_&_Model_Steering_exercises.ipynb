In this case, it's a tuple of 2 tensors, the first of which is the actual layer output (the thing we want).\n","    * Doing operations on a proxy still returns a proxy - this is why we can index into the `output` proxy tuple and get a proxy tensor!\n","* `.save()` takes this proxy output, and returns the actual object (which you can now access outside the context manager).\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>A bit more detail on <code>save</code> (optional)</summary>\n","\n","To be more specific, `.save()` informs the **intervention computational graph** to clone the value of a proxy, allowing us to access the value of a proxy after the forward pass.\n","\n","During processing of the intervention computational graph we are building, when the value of a proxy is no longer needed, its value is dereferenced and destroyed. If you've saved it, then you'll be able to access the value of the proxy after this happens (i.e. outside the context manager).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Optional exercise - we mentioned that <code>.output</code> returns a tuple of 2 tensors. Can you use the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html\">documentation page</a> what the second tensor in this tuple is?</summary>\n","\n","The second output is also a tuple of tensors, of length 2. In the GPT-J source code, they are called `present`. They represent the keys and values which were calculated in this forward pass (as opposed to those that were calculated in an earlier forward pass, and cached by the model). Since we're only generating one new token, these are just the full keys and values.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The next command:\n","\n","```python\n","logits = model.lm_head.output[0, -1].save()\n","```\n","\n","can be understood in a very similar way. The only difference is that we're accessing the output of `lm_head`, the language modelling head (i.e. the unembedding at the very end), and the output is just a tensor of shape `(batch, seq, d_vocab)` rather than a tuple of tensors. Again, see the [documentation page](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html) for this.\n","\n","If you've worked with Hugging Face models then you might be used to getting logits directly from the model output, but here we generally extract logits from the model internals just like any other activation because this allows us to **control exactly what we return.** If we return lots of very large tensors, this can take quite a while to download from the server (remember that `d_vocab` is often very large for transformers, i.e. around 50k). See the \"which objects to save\" section below for more discussion on this.\n","\n","### Output vs input\n","\n","You can also extract a module's input using `.input` or `.inputs`. If a module's forward method is called as `module.forward(*args, **kwargs)` then `.inputs` returns a tuple of `(tuple_of_args, dict_of_kwargs)`. Alternatively, `.input` is an alias for `.inputs[0][0]`, in other words it returns the first arg from the module's forward method (which is usually the tensor we want).\n","\n","Remember that if you're not sure then you can debug with `print(module.input.shape)` - even if `.inputs` is a tuple of inputs, this will work to recursively print the shape of all the tensors in the tuple, rather than causing an error.\n","\n","### Which objects to save\n","\n","Note that we saved `logits` above, which is a vector of length 50k. In general, it's best to save as small an object as possible, because this reduces the size of object you'll have to download from the server. For example, if you only want the next token completions, just argmax the logits and then save the result! All basic tensor operations can be performed within your context manager."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h9NsqtGw1HeV"},"source":["## Putting this into practice"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6DeopWP61HeV"},"source":["### Exercise - visualize attention heads\n","\n","> ```yaml\n","> Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪\n","> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪\n",">\n","> You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.\n","> ```\n","\n","We just covered a lot of content, so lets put it into practice.

But we can actually do both at once: we can compute $h$ within our forward pass, and then intervene with it on a different forward pass (using our zero-shot prompts), all within the same `model.trace` context manager. In other words, **we'll be using `with tracer.invoke...` three times** in this context manager.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/h-intervention-3.png\" width=\"1000\">\n","\n","You should fill in the `calculate_h_and_intervene` function below, to do this. Mostly, this should involve combining your `calculate_h` and `intervene_with_h` functions, and wrapping the forward passes in the same context manager (plus a bit of code rewriting).\n","\n","Your output should be exactly the same as before (since the `ICLDataset` class is deterministic), hence we've not provided test functions in this case - you can just compare the table you get to the one before! However, this time around your code should run twice as fast, because you're batching the operations of \"compute $h$\" and \"intervene with $h$\" together into a single forward pass.\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Help - I'm not sure how to use the <code>h</code> vector inside the context manager.</summary>\n","\n","You extract `h` the same way as before, but you don't need to save it. It is kept as a proxy. You can still use it later in the context manager, just like it actually was a tensor.\n","\n","You shouldn't have to `.save()` anything inside your context manager, other than the token completions.\n","\n","</details>\n","<details>\n","<summary>Help - If I want to add <code>x</code> vector to a slice of my hidden state tensor <code>h</code>, is <code>h[slice]+=x</code> the same as <code>h2 = h[slice], h2 += x</code>?</summary>\n","\n","No, only `h[slice]+=x` does what you want. This is because when doing <code>h2 = h[slice], h2 += x</code>, the modification line <code>h2 += x</code> is no longer modifying the original tensor `h`, but a different tensor`h2`. In contrast, `h[slice]+=x` keeps the original tensor `h` in the modification line.\n","\n","A good rule to keep in mind is: If you're trying to modify a tensor some in-place operation, make sure that

is to actually calculate and return the function vector, so we can do a few experiments with it. The function vector is the sum of the outputs of all the attention heads we found using the previous function (i.e. the sum of all of the vectors these heads write to the residual stream), averaged over the prompts in our dataset.\n","\n","There's a difficulty here - rather than just getting the `z` vectors, we're actually trying to get the `attn_out` vectors, but *before* they're summed over heads. As we discussed previously, this is a bit tricky to do for the model we're working with, because the `out_proj` linear map actually does the \"project up\" and \"sum over heads\" operations simultaneously. It would be nice to just take a slice of the `out_proj` matrix and multiply it with a slice of the `z` vector, but the `nnsight` library doesn't yet allow users to access weights directly (for security reasons). To understand how we can extract the `attn_out` vector for a head separately without accessing the underlying weights, you should go back to read the subsection **A note on `out_proj`** at the start of this section."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(model)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oGyPOEGQiXOj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767371283832,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Aayush

to replicate some of the results in Table 3, in the paper:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/tab3.png\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","This will involve doing something we haven't done before - **intervening on multi-token prompt generation**.\n","\n","Most of the interpretability exercises in this chapter have just consisted of running single forward passes, rather than autoregressive text generation. But we're trying something different here: we're adding the function vector to the final sequence position at each forward pass during text generation, and seeing if we can get the model to output a sentence with a different meaning.\n","\n","The results of Table 3 came from adding the function vector to the residual stream at the final sequence position of the original prompt, **and the final sequence position for each subsequent generation.** The reason we do this is to guide the model's behaviour over time. Our hypothesis is that the function vector induces \"next-token antonym behaviour\" (because it was calculated by averaging attention head outputs at the sequence position before the model made its antonym prediction in the ICL prompts).\n","\n","### Using `nnsight` for multi-token generation\n","\n","Previously, our context managers have looked like:\n","\n","```python\n","# Single invoke\n","with model.trace(prompt, remote=REMOTE):\n","    ... # Intervene on fwd pass\n","\n","# Multiple invokes\n","with model.trace(remote=REMOTE) as tracer:\n","    with tracer.invoke(prompt):\n","        ... # Intervene on fwd pass\n","```\n","\n","But for multi-token generation, we'll be using the `generate` method rather than `trace`. Our context managers will look like:\n","\n","```python\n","# Single invoke\n","with model.generate(prompt, remote=REMOTE, max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens):\n","    for n in range(max_new_tokens):\n","        ... # Intervene on fwd pass for n-th token to be generated\n","        model.next()\n","\n","# Multiple invokes\n","with model.generate(max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens, remote=REMOTE) as generator:\n","    with generator.invoke(prompt):\n","\n","        for n in range(max_new_tokens):\n","            ... # Intervene on fwd pass for n-th token to be generated\n","            model.next()\n","```\n","\n","The line `model.next()` denotes that the following interventions should be applied to the forward pass which generates the *next* token.\n","\n","Mostly, everything you learned during single-token generation generalizes to the multi-token case. For example, using `.save()` still saves proxies outside the context managers (although make sure that you don't use the same variable names over different generations, otherwise you'll overwrite them - it's easier to store your saved proxies in e.g. a list or dict).\n","\n","Note that `model.generate` takes the same arguments as the normal [HuggingFace generate method](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/text_generation). This means we can use arguments like `top_k`, `top_p`, or `repetition_penalty` to control generation behaviour. In the exercises below we use a repetition penalty (we choose a value of 1.2, in line with the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858) that suggested it) - this can avoid the model falling into loops of repeating the same sequence, which is especially common in steering when we're pushing the model OOD.\n","\n","<!-- #### Optional questions - multi-token generation with NNsight\n","\n","Here are a few quick optional questions to test your understanding of how multi-generation works with NNsight.

In our exercises, we'll only be intervening on the last seqpos so you don't need to worry about it, but it's still a useful topic to understand.\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>See this dropdown if you're curious for more details.</summary>\n","\n","To speed up inference, transformer models perform **key-value caching** to speed up text generation. This means that the time taken to generate $n$ tokens is ***much*** less than $n$ times longer than generating a single token. See [this blog post](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/) for more on transformer inference arithmetic.\n","\n","When caching takes place, and we're doing causal interventions, we have to be careful that the caching won't override our causal interventions. Sometimes caching has to be disabled to make sure that our causal intervention works correctly. For example, if we wanted to perform the intervention \"add the function vector to *only* the final sequence position of the prompt for each token we generate\" then we'd have to disable caching (since previous forward passes would contain cached values where we intervened on a sequence position which is no longer the final sequence position). However, here we're performing the intervention \"add the function vector to the final token of the original prompt, and to *all subsequent sequence positions*\", meaning enabling caching (the default behaviour) will give us the right causal intervention.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","### Generator Output\n","\n","The object `generator.output` is by default a tensor which contains the model's token ID completions (not the logits).\n","\n","By default the `generate` method will generate tokens greedily, i.e. always taking the maximum-probability token at each step.

In these next exercises, we'll explore this kind of work in more detail. We'll be primarily using Turner et al's work on [Steering GPT-2-XL by adding an activation vector](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector).\n","\n","Summary of the way in which this work differs from the function vector work we've done so far:\n","\n","* Function vectors focused on the model performing a particular function (e.g. mapping a word to its opposite), whereas this work focuses on behavioural changes (e.g. completing a prompt which has negative tone in a positive way).\n","* Function vectors work looked at very large models (our exercises used Pythia-7B, the smallest model which was examined in the function vectors paper). This particular steering vectors post focused on the smaller models GPT2-Small (85m) and GPT2-XL (1.5B). We'll be focusing on GPT2-XL.\n","* The second half of our function vectors work identified important attention heads and focused on their outputs, rather than just adding to the residual stream directly. In this steering vector setup, we'll go back to the simpler method of adding directly into the residual stream.\n","\n","Despite these differences, much of the work which was done here overlaps with function vector work, since they both fall into the broader category of *\"finding vectors using forward-pass-based methods (i.e. not with SGD) and using them to intervene on models during forward passes & change the model's output\"*. This description would also include the following:\n","\n","* [Inference-time intervention](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kuQfnotjkQA4Kkfou/inference-time-intervention-eliciting-truthful-answers-from), which focuses on inducing the behavioural change of \"making the model tell the truth\". It also looks at other non-forward-pass-based techniques for finding an intervention vector, e.g. CCS and linear probing, although it concludes that forward-pass-based methods similar to the ones we've been using so far work the best.\n","* [Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681), which can be thought of as an extension of the GPT2-XL steering vector work to larger models, specifically Llama 2 13B.

Rather than adding a single vector to the final sequence position at each token generation, we're adding a slice of vectors to the first sequence positions of the original prompt (see tables like in [this section](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector#1__Love___Hate) for an illustration). How do you think this will affect our function? Should we still cache? Should we be using `.generate()` or `.trace()`? If using `.generate()`, do we need to call `model.next()` ?\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Click this dropdown for answers to the questions above.</summary>\n","\n","Rather than adding to each final sequence position for every token generated, we just add the vectors once, to the end of the prompt. This means that:\n","\n","- We can still use caching (because the values we cache shouldn't be different in subsequent token generations),\n","- We should be using `.generate()` (because we're doing multi-token generation),\n","- We don't need to call `model.next()` (because we only intervene once, and our intervention will be cached & applied to all subsequent tokens which are generated).\n","\n","Again, if any of this is confusing then please ask a TA or message in the Slack channel.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","### Padding\n","\n","The [tables](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector#1__Love___Hate) show the activations being added on the left (i.e. the sequences are padded on the right), but by default padding is applied on the left. There are 2 possible ways you can get around this:\n","\n","1. Right-pad the input sequences manually, i.e. use something like `len(tokenizer.tokenize(prompt))` to see how long each of the prompts is, and add copies of `tokenizer.pad_token` to the end of each sequence.\n","2. Don't manually pad the input sequences, instead slice the sequences you add to the original prompt from the right side of the activation addition sequences, rather than from the left side.\n","\n","The solutions use (2), but you can use either of these methods.\n","\n","### Sampling\n","\n","Following the post, we'll use top-p sampling with probability 0.3 to generate our sequences. We'll also use a small frequency penalty to penalize repetition (so the model gets stuck in loops less). If you've done earlier exercises in this section then you might have implemented `freq_penalty` during sampling; this is supported by TransformerLens models, but HuggingFace uses the somewhat similar `repetition_penalty` (default value is 1.0 indicating no penalty, values higher than 1.0 apply a penalty to repeated tokens).\n","\n","We apply these sampling methods by passing keyword arguments into the `generate` method:\n","\n","```python\n","{\n","    \"do_sample\": True, # necessary whenever we're sampling rather than doing greedy decoding\n","    \"top_p\": 0.3,\n","    \"repetition_penalty\": 1.1,\n","}\n","```\n","\n","Note that the sequences are generated stochastically rather than greedily - this means we'll get different results if we input multiple different copies of the same sequence. We've given you the `n_comparisons` argument in the function below, i.e. you should generate this many steered *and* this many unsteered completions.\n","\n","### Other tips / notes\n","\n","We recommend starting with example #9 (the \"talking about weddings\" one). It seems quite robust to the exact conditions of the forward pass, unlike the `Love - Hate` example. You can use any of the template cells we've given you below.\n","\n","We've given you a `use_bos` argument; if this is True then you should append `tokenizer.bos_token` to the start of all the prompts. This is just to be true to the LessWrong post's implementation; it won't change behaviour much and you can probably ignore it and still get good results."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"dDTPcUwM1Hef"},"outputs":[],"source":["SAMPLING_KWARGS = {\n","    \"do_sample\": True,\n","    \"top_p\": 0.3,\n","    \"repetition_penalty\": 1.2,\n","}\n","\n","\n","def calculate_and_apply_steering_vector(\n","    model: LanguageModel,\n","    prompt: str,\n","    activation_additions: list[tuple[int, float, str]],\n","    n_tokens: int,\n","    n_comparisons: int = 1,\n","    use_bos: bool = True,\n",") -> tuple[list[str], list[str]]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Performs the steering vector experiments described in the LessWrong post.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        model: LanguageModel\n","            the transformer you're doing this computation with\n","        prompt: str\n","            The original prompt, which we'll be doing activation steering on.\n","\n","        activation_additions: list[tuple[int, float, str]], each tuple contains:\n","            layer -
