Choosing a suitable task and trying to reverse engineer a model can be a rich area of interesting circuits to interpret!

It seems likely that there’s a lot of low-hanging fruit left to pluck when studying toy language models!\n","\n","So, why care about studying toy language models? The obvious reason is that **it’s way easier to get traction**. In particular, the [inputs and outputs](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=UriJZK6E8dnL8NDY-fGl_eFX) of a model are intrinsically interpretable, and in a toy model there’s just not as much space between the inputs and outputs for weird complexity to build up. But the obvious objection to the above is that, ultimately, we care about understanding real models (and ideally extremely large ones like GPT-3), and learning to interpret toy models is not the actual goal. This is a pretty valid objection, but there are two natural ways that studying toy models can be valuable:\n","\n","The first is by finding fundamental circuits that recur in larger models, and [motifs](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/#claim-2-motifs) that allow us to easily identify these circuits in larger models. A key underlying question here is that of [universality](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/#claim-3): does each model learn its own weird way of completing its task, or are there some fundamental principles and algorithms that all models converge on?\n","\n","The second is by forming a better understanding of how to reverse engineer models - what are the right intuitions and conceptual frameworks, what tooling and techniques do and do not work, and what weird limitations we might be faced with. For instance, the work in A Mathematical Framework presents ideas like [the residual stream as the central object](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=DHp9vZ0h9lA9OCrzG2Y3rrzH), and the significance of the [QK-Circuits](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=n_Lc0Z5N9HMhAYcycDda-UEB) and [OV-Circuits](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=n_Lc0Z5N9HMhAYcycDda-UEB), which seem to generalise to many different models. We'll also see an example later in these exercises which illustrates how MLPs can be thought of as a collection of neurons which activate on different features, just like many seem to in language models. But there’s also ways it can be misleading, and some techniques that work well in toy models seem to generalise less well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9NpkOpz9zdJY"},"source":["## The purpose / structure of these exercises\n","\n","At a surface level, these exercises are designed to guide you through a partial interpretation of the bidirectional model trained on bracket classification.

It's small so we can run experiments quickly, but big enough to perform well on the task. The weights and architecture are provided for you.\n","\n","### Causal vs bidirectional attention\n","\n","The key difference between this and the GPT-style models you will have implemented already is the attention mechanism.\n","\n","GPT uses **causal attention**, where the attention scores get masked wherever the source token comes after the destination token. This means that information can only flow forwards in a model, never backwards (which is how we can train our model in parallel - our model's output is a series of distributions over the next token, where each distribution is only able to use information from the tokens that came before). This model uses **bidirectional attention**, where the attention scores aren't masked based on the relative positions of the source and destination tokens. This means that information can flow in both directions, and the model can use information from the future to predict the past.\n","\n","### Using transformers for classification\n","\n","GPT is trained via gradient descent on the cross-entropy loss between its predictions for the next token and the actual next tokens. Models designed to perform classification are trained in a very similar way, but instead of outputting probability distributions over the next token, they output a distribution over class labels. We do this by having an unembedding matrix of size `[d_model, num_classifications]`, and only using a single sequence position (usually the 0th position) to represent our classification probabilities.\n","\n","Below is a schematic to compare the model architectures and how they're used:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/gpt-vs-bert-last.png\" width=\"1250\">\n","\n","Note that, just because the outputs at all other sequence positions are discarded, doesn't mean those sequence positions aren't useful. They will almost certainly be the sites of important intermediate calculations. But it does mean that the model will always have to move the information from those positions to the 0th position in order for the information to be used for classification.\n","\n","### A note on softmax\n","\n","For each bracket sequence, our (important) output is a vector of two values: `(l0, l1)`, representing the model's logit distribution over (unbalanced, balanced). Our model was trained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between these logits and the true labels. Interestingly, since logits are translation invariant, the only value we actually care about is the difference between our logits, `l0 - l1`. This is the model's log likelihood ratio of the sequence being unbalanced vs balanced. Later on, we'll be able to use this `logit_diff` to perform logit attribution in our model.\n","\n","### Masking padding tokens\n","\n","The image on the top-right is actually slightly incomplete. It doesn't show how our model handles sequences of differing lengths. After all, during training we need to have all sequences be of the same length so we can batch them together in a single tensor. The model manages this via two new tokens: the end token and the padding token.\n","\n","The end token goes at the end of every bracket sequence, and then we add padding tokens to the end until the sequence is up to some fixed length. For instance, this model was trained on bracket sequences of up to length 40, so if we wanted to classify the bracket string `(())` then we would pad it to the length-42 sequence:\n","\n","```\n","[start] + ( + ( + ) + ) + [end] + [pad] + [pad] + ... + [pad]\n","```\n","\n","When we calculate the attention scores, we mask them at all (query, key) positions where the key is a padding token. This makes sure that information doesn't flow from padding tokens to other tokens in the sequence (just like how GPT's causal masking makes sure that information doesn't flow from future tokens to past tokens).\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/gpt-vs-bert-4.png\" width=\"950\">\n","\n","Note that the attention scores aren't masked when the query is a padding token and the key isn't. In theory, this means that information can be stored in the padding token positions. However, because the padding token key positions are always masked, this information can't flow back into the rest of the sequence, so it never affects the final output. (Also, note that if we masked query positions as well, we'd get numerical errors, since we'd be taking softmax across a row where every element is minus infinity, which is not well-defined!)\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Aside on how this relates to <b>BERT</b></summary>\n","\n","This is all very similar to how the bidirectional transformer **BERT** works:\n","\n","* BERT has the `[CLS]` (classification) token rather than `[start]`; but it works exactly the same.\n","* BERT has the `[SEP]` (separation) token rather than `[end]`; this has a similar function but also serves a special purpose when it is used in **NSP** (next sentence prediction).\n","\n","If you're interested in reading more on this, you can check out [this link](https://albertauyeung.github.io/2020/06/19/bert-tokenization.html/).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","We've implemented this type of masking for you, using TransformerLens's **permanent hooks** feature.

You should include a fit coefficient in your regression (this is the default for `LinearRegression`).\n","\n","Note, we have the `seq_pos` argument because sometimes we'll want to fit the regression over all sequence positions and sometimes we'll only care about some and not others (e.g. for the final layernorm in the model, we only care about the 0th position because that's where we take the prediction from; all other positions are discarded)."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression"],"metadata":{"id":"dela1CjGFERn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767195565065,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Aayush Verma","userId":"08474324267284002295"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":38,"metadata":{"id":"s2anB_zuzdJh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767197142433,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":41396,"user":{"displayName":"Aayush Verma","userId":"08474324267284002295"}},"outputId":"5ca19b33-5545-4d68-f744-4e7d15165db5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["All tests in `test_get_ln_fit` passed!\n","r^2 for LN_final, at sequence position 0: 0.9808\n","r^2 for LN1, layer 1, over all sequence positions: 0.9599\n"]}],"source":["def get_activations(\n","    model: HookedTransformer, toks: Int[Tensor, \"batch seq\"], names: list[str]\n",") -> ActivationCache:\n","    \"\"\"Uses hooks to return activations from the model, in the form of an ActivationCache.\"\"\"\n","    names_list = [names] if isinstance(names, str) else names\n","    _, cache = model.run_with_cache(\n","        toks,\n","        return_type=None,\n","        names_filter=lambda name: name in names_list,\n","    )\n","    return cache\n","\n","\n","def get_activation(model: HookedTransformer, toks: Int[Tensor, \"batch seq\"], name: str):\n","    \"\"\"Gets a single activation.\"\"\"\n","    return get_activations(model, toks, [name])[name]\n","\n","\n","def LN_hook_names(layernorm: nn.Module) -> tuple[str, str]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Returns the names of the hooks immediately before and after a given layernorm.\n","\n","    Example:\n","        model.final_ln -> (\"blocks.2.hook_resid_post\", \"ln_final.hook_normalized\")\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if layernorm.name == \"ln_final\":\n","        input_hook_name = utils.get_act_name(\"resid_post\", 2)\n","        output_hook_name = \"ln_final.hook_normalized\"\n","    else:\n","        layer, ln = layernorm.name.split(\".\")[1:]\n","        input_hook_name = utils.get_act_name(\"resid_pre\" if ln == \"ln1\" else \"resid_mid\", layer)\n","        output_hook_name = utils.get_act_name(\"normalized\", layer, ln)\n","\n","    return input_hook_name, output_hook_name\n","\n","\n","def get_ln_fit(\n","    model: HookedTransformer,\n","    data: BracketsDataset,\n","    layernorm: nn.Module,\n","    seq_pos: int | None = None,\n",") -> tuple[LinearRegression, float]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Fits a linear regression, where the inputs are the values just before the layernorm given by the\n","    input argument `layernorm`, and the values to predict are the layernorm's outputs.\n","\n","    if `seq_pos` is None, find best fit aggregated over all sequence positions.
